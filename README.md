# seattle_AirBnB

This repo contains code and data for Air BnB listings in Seattle. The is publicly avaialble on Kaggle is provided by AirBnB. I'll be trying the answer the following three questions using the data;

#### Question 1: Which areas are expensive or more visited as compared to others?
#### Question 2: How does the price and availibility vary during the year?
#### Question 3: What are the factors that influence price the most?

## Requirements:

- python 3.8.8
- pandas 1.2.4
- numpy 1.20.1
- matplotlib 3.3.4
- sklearn 0.24.1
- seaborn 0.11.1



## Files in the Repo:

 - `seattle_airbnb_data.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis
 
Data Directory:

In the data folder
The data is mainly split into three files.

 - `Calender`: This contains the price and availability of listings over the course of one year
 - `Listings`: This contains the information about the listing
 - `Reviews`: This table contains the reviews each listing has received
