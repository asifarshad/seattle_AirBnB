# seattle_AirBnB

This repo contains code and data for Air BnB listings in Seattle. In the Python notebook you can find basic exploration of the data and then some insights I have derived using the data. 

The data is mainly split into three files.

Calender: This contains the price and availability of listings over the course of one year
Listings: This contains the information about the listing
Reviews: This table contains the reviews each listing has received

I am trying to answer 3 questions using the data.

#### Question 1:Which areas are expensive or more visited as compared to others?
#### Question 2:How does the price and availibility vary during the year?
#### Question 3:What are the factors that influence price the most?
